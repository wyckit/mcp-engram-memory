# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-21

Headline: **multi-agent memory sharing is now officially supported.** The
sharing API surface (`AGENT_ID`, `share_namespace`, `unshare_namespace`,
`list_shared`, `whoami`, `cross_search`) is declared stable under SemVer
for the 0.x line — breaking changes to these tools will bump the minor
version. See `docs/multi-agent.md` for the quick-start and the explicit
boundaries (single server process per data directory, global write-lock
throughput ceiling).

### Added
- **`CognitiveIndex.EntryUpserted` / `EntryDeleted` events**: real-time
  notification for parallel agents. Events fire **after** the internal
  write lock is released, so handlers can call back into the index
  safely. `UpsertBatch` raises one `EntryUpserted` per accepted entry.
  Enables zero-poll fan-in patterns (see
  `tests/McpEngramMemory.Tests/ParallelAgentTests.cs::RealtimeSharing_*`).
- **`cross_search` parameter parity (partial)**: new optional params
  `minScore`, `category`, `diversity`, `diversityLambda` match
  `search_memory` defaults. `SearchMultiple` routes through the
  `SearchRequest` path when `diversity` is requested so cluster-aware
  MMR reranking applies per namespace before RRF merge.
  Known gap: `expand_graph`, `expand_query`, `use_physics`, and
  `temperature` are single-namespace orchestration features that remain
  exclusive to `search_memory` — documented in `docs/multi-agent.md`.
- **`docs/multi-agent.md`**: quick-start, permission semantics, live
  event subscription pattern, explicit v0.8.0 boundaries and
  troubleshooting.
- **Parallel-agent test suite** (`ParallelAgentTests.cs`, 9 tests):
  `ConcurrentShare_PreservesAllGrants` (regression for the lost-update
  race), `ConcurrentEnsureOwnership_FirstWriterWins`,
  `ConcurrentCrossSearch_WithShareChurn_NoExceptions`,
  `ParallelAgents_ConcurrentStoresToOwnNamespaces_NoLostWrites`,
  `ParallelAgents_ConcurrentWritesToSharedNamespace_AllVisible`,
  `ConcurrentDuplicateIdInsert_NoTornWrite`,
  `RealtimeSharing_ReaderObservesWriterEvent`,
  `RealtimeSharing_FanInFromMultipleWriters_NoDroppedEvents`,
  `ConcurrentAccessCheck_ConsistentVisibility`.
- **`tests/McpEngramMemory.Tests/xunit.runner.json`**: enables
  `parallelizeTestCollections=true` with `maxParallelThreads=4` for
  deterministic parallel test execution.

### Fixed
- **Lost-update race in `NamespaceRegistry.Share` / `Unshare` /
  `EnsureOwnership`**: concurrent grants to the same namespace could
  silently drop prior grants because the read-modify-write on the
  permission entry was unsynchronized. Fixed with a per-namespace
  `ConcurrentDictionary<string, object>` of monitors. Grants to
  different namespaces stay parallel; grants to the same namespace
  serialize. Double-checked locking keeps `EnsureOwnership` lock-free
  on the registered-path. Regression test:
  `ConcurrentShare_PreservesAllGrants` (32 concurrent shares).

### Documentation
- **XML doc disambiguation**: `CliExecutableResolver` points its
  `Process.Start` cref at the `(ProcessStartInfo)` overload (fixes
  CS0419). `HybridSearchEngine` constants moved out from between the
  `HybridSearch` method's `<param>` tags and its signature so the 11
  CS1572 warnings go away; `queryVector` and `entryCount` parameter
  docs added.
- **API stability declaration** for the multi-agent sharing surface
  in `docs/multi-agent.md` (v0.8.0 boundary note).

### Known gaps (tracked for 0.8.1 / 0.9.0)
- **Namespace-partitioned write locks on `CognitiveIndex`**: the
  existing single `ReaderWriterLockSlim` gates all writers across all
  namespaces. Research for the refactor (BM25Index ConcurrentDictionary
  upgrade, `_idToNamespace` coordination, per-ns RWL) is complete but
  out of scope for 0.8.0; a future release will lift the
  single-process-writer ceiling.
- **Cross-process sharing**: SQLite WAL prevents on-disk corruption
  across processes, but `NamespaceStore._loadedNamespaces` is a
  one-shot cache with no cross-process invalidation. One
  `mcp-engram-memory` server process per data directory remains the
  supported topology; a later release will add a version-counter-based
  refresh protocol.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **`OllamaClient.GenerateStreamAsync`**: NDJSON token-by-token streaming via `IAsyncEnumerable<string>`, with stop-token array threaded through to Ollama for early termination. Enables incremental UI updates without waiting for a full generation.
- **`OllamaClient.KeepAlive`**: public property serialized as Ollama's `keep_alive` on every `/api/generate`. Set to `"24h"` to prevent Ollama from unloading models after its default 5-minute idle timeout — eliminates the 10–40 s reload tax on the first call after a pause.
- **`OllamaOptions.Stop`**: stop-token array plumbed through the request payload.
- **Cross-CLI MRCR benchmark drivers**: `CodexCliModelClient` (spawns `codex exec -o <tempfile>`) and `GeminiCliModelClient` (spawns `gemini -p ""` with stdin prompt) join the existing `ClaudeCliModelClient`. Each charges against the vendor subscription, not API keys. New `CliExecutableResolver` probes PATH for `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` variants so npm-installed CLI shims on Windows resolve correctly. UTF-8 stdin/stdout encoding is now forced across all three clients (fixes codex's "input is not valid UTF-8 at offset N" failure on prompts containing emoji).
- **Cross-CLI 8-needle comparison (2026-04-19, n=25 stratified)**:
    - gemini-cli/gemini-2.5-pro: **0.994 sim / 100% pass**
    - codex-cli/gpt-5.4-mini:    **0.993 sim / 100% pass**
    - claude-cli/opus:            0.987 sim /  96% pass
    - codex-cli/gpt-5.4:          0.973 sim /  96% pass
    - gemini-cli/gemini-2.5-flash:0.965 sim /  88% pass
    - claude-cli/sonnet:          0.912 sim /  72% pass
  All at 99.7% prompt-token reduction. Flagships don't always win: gpt-5.4-mini beats gpt-5.4 on ordinal engram; Gemini 2.5 Pro ties for best overall.
- Tightened ordinal prompt to explicitly ask for verbatim snippet reproduction (needed for Gemini 2.5 Pro to stop truncating long needles; Claude and Codex were already interpreting the earlier phrasing correctly).
- **Ordinal-aware engram retrieval mode for MRCR**: `MrcrGenerationOptions.EngramMode = "ordinal"` enables pair-wise ingest that tags each assistant turn with its user-ask category signature and within-category 1-based ordinal (stored on `CognitiveEntry.Metadata["ordinal"]`). A new `MrcrProbeParser` extracts `(RandomString, Ordinal, Category)` from the "Prepend X to the Nth (1 indexed) Y" probe template, and retrieval resolves to an exact category+ordinal lookup via `CognitiveIndex.GetAllInNamespace`. Probes that don't match the template fall back to hybrid search.
  - 25-probe stratified run (2026-04-19, contexts 18K–571K approx tokens):
    - **Opus ordinal engram = 0.987 sim / 96% pass / 14,556 prompt tokens (n=25)**; on the matched set where full_context also ran (n=14), Opus ordinal engram (0.979) beats Opus full_context (0.936).
    - Sonnet ordinal engram = 0.912 sim / 72% pass across n=25; on the matched set Sonnet full_context (0.993) beats ordinal engram (0.898) — Sonnet is very strong at long-context recall when the prompt fits.
    - 11/25 probes exceed Claude's 200K limit — full_context cannot run there, ordinal engram hits 0.997 sim / 100% pass for Opus on the oversized set.
    - Prompt-token reduction: **99.7% (320× fewer tokens, 14,556 vs 4,657,645)**.
  - 2/4/8-needle scaling run (2026-04-19): same harness, 25 stratified probes per variant, `openai/mrcr` parquet source. Ordinal engram holds **sim ≥ 0.912 with 72-96% pass** across every variant at the constant **99.7% (320×) prompt-token reduction**. Opus + ordinal engram beats Opus + full_context on the matched set for both 4-needle (0.975 vs 0.944) and 8-needle (0.979 vs 0.936); 2-needle is saturated (both arms ≥0.955).
  - New MRCR engram expert `mrcr_benchmark_methodologist` registered via `create_expert` (auto-classified under `information_retrieval` → `ai_and_knowledge`, 0.796 confidence). Seeded with 6 linked memories documenting probe grammar, ingest pattern, retrieval policy, Claude CLI driver, scoring, and the context-ceiling regime finding.
  - Artifact filenames now include the engram mode: `{dataset}-mrcr-{provider}-{model}-{mode}.json`.
  - 12 new probe-parser unit tests.
- **MRCR v2 (8-needle) long-context benchmark**: A/B harness that drives the Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`) via the user's subscription — no Anthropic API key required.
  - `run_mrcr_benchmark` runs two arms on the same probes: `full_context` (entire conversation in prompt) vs. `engram_retrieval` (hybrid BM25+vector search returns top-K chunks).
  - `compare_mrcr_artifacts` reports per-arm similarity / pass-rate deltas and the change in prompt-token reduction ratio.
  - Scoring uses local `bge-micro-v2` cosine similarity — matches the MRCR paper's metric and stays API-cost-free.
  - New `claude-cli` provider in `AgentOutcomeModelClientFactory` shells out to `claude -p --model <name>` with prompts piped over stdin (bypasses shell-argument-length limits on 128K contexts).
  - Dataset loader + HF download recipe in `benchmarks/datasets/mrcr-v2/README.md` (dataset is gitignored).
  - Methodology, usage, and interpretation guide in `docs/benchmarks-mrcr.md`.

### Fixed
- **`publish-nuget.ps1` test filter** now excludes `LiveBenchmark` and `T2Benchmark` traits alongside `MSA`, so live-Ollama benchmark tests (`DeepSeekBenchmarkRun`, `ReasoningBenchmarkRun`, `T2LiveBenchmarkRun`, `T2BenchmarkRun`) no longer run on every publish and hit 120 s HttpClient timeouts.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Memory Graph Visualizer**: `get_graph_snapshot` MCP tool returns a `GraphSnapshot` with nodes, typed edges, cluster memberships, and corpus stats. Companion D3.js viewer (`visualization/memory-graph.html`) renders a force-directed graph with Obsidian/Nexus dark aesthetic: gold entry points, cyan LTM, teal STM, gray archived.
- **Visualizer Features**: Zoom 0.01–6×, right-click drag to rotate, filter pills (STM / LTM / Archived / Connected-only), fractal density overlay below zoom k=0.20 (leaf-only rendering anchored to node bounding box), search bar with live node highlighting (matches pulse gold, non-matches dim to 4%), ›/‹ buttons + Enter/Shift+Enter to cycle through results with a 1/N counter, Esc or × to clear.
- `get_graph_snapshot` registered in `full` profile only (`VisualizationTools.cs`). 10 new unit tests.
- Benchmark suite expanded to 34 result files across 12 datasets in `benchmarks/2026-04-16/`.

### Changed
- **Architecture Cleanup**: Removed 12 dead-code and bug items — duplicate `CosineSimilarity` / `DotProduct` overloads on `VectorMath`, stale `ScaleTunedTests.cs` test infrastructure, obsolete lifecycle fields (`_lastDecay`, `_lastSave` serialization remnants), and corrected `DeleteMemory` method signature mismatch.
- Total tests: **850** (up from 842). All 850 pass across net8.0.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **SQLite Multi-Instance Lock Contention**: Added `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000` to `SqliteStorageProvider.OpenConnection()` and `DeleteNamespaceAsync()`. When multiple MCP server instances share the same `memory.db`, the second instance's schema initialization DDL would fail with `SQLITE_BUSY` after a 30-second hang because the first instance held the WAL write lock. SQLite now retries for up to 5 seconds on lock contention instead of immediately failing. Also fixed `DeleteNamespaceAsync()` bypassing `OpenConnection()` and missing the `busy_timeout` and `synchronous=NORMAL` pragmas.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Cluster-Aware MMR Diversity Reranking**: New `DiversityReranker` applies Maximal Marginal Relevance with cluster and category penalties to spread search results across sub-topics. Activated via `diversity: true` on `search_memory`. Configurable lambda trade-off (0.0 = pure diversity, 1.0 = pure relevance, default 0.5).
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: `ci.yml` pipeline on push/PR to main — builds, tests (excluding MSA), and packs NuGet on all 3 TFMs. `benchmark.yml` runs nightly MSA benchmarks at 6 AM UTC with manual dispatch.
- **`disambiguation-v1` benchmark**: Dense-domain disambiguation dataset — 4 clusters × 5 seeds + 4 distractors, 10 queries (broad/cross-cluster/narrow) measuring result diversity across semantically dense namespaces.
- **Spreading Activation Service**: Collins & Loftus spreading activation model for graph-coupled energy transfer with depth-3 recursive propagation and cluster-based pre-warming.
- **SLM Synthesis Engine**: Map-reduce synthesis via Ollama for dense reasoning over large memory sets without expanding context windows.
- **`get_context_block` tool**: Prompt-cache-aware context assembly for LLM consumption.
- **`synthesize_memories` tool**: Map-reduce synthesis via Ollama for dense reasoning over large memory sets.
- **`physics-v1` in MSA benchmark suite**: 4 modes (vector, vector_rerank, hybrid, hybrid_rerank) added to nightly MSA benchmarks.
- 108 new tests (total: 842 across 3 frameworks, up from 734).
- Total tools: 52 (up from 50).

### Changed
- **ONNX Concurrent Inference**: Removed `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` bottleneck. All scratch buffers (input IDs, attention mask, token type IDs, shape) moved to per-call `ArrayPool` allocations. `InferenceSession.Run()` now runs fully concurrent.
- **Namespace-Partitioned Locking**: `NamespaceStore` converted from `Dictionary` to `ConcurrentDictionary` for all 4 internal collections. Per-namespace load locks with double-check pattern for safe lazy loading. `CognitiveIndex` read paths switched from `UpgradeableReadLock` (1 thread) to `ReadLock` (N concurrent threads) at 10 call sites.
- **Expert System Consolidation**: Linked 6 orphaned high-use experts to domain tree parent nodes. Deleted 36 dead/duplicate expert entries. Broadened `information_retrieval` branch node persona description for improved hierarchical routing.
- **MCP Tool Test Coverage**: 8 previously untested tool classes now have dedicated test files (AdminTools, BenchmarkTools, ClusterTools, GraphTools, IntelligenceTools, LifecycleTools, MultiAgentTools, SynthesisTools) with 85 new tests.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **HNSW Graph Persistence**: HNSW indices are now serialized to disk as topology-only snapshots (`{ns}.hnsw.json` for JSON backend, `global_data` for SQLite). Vectors are reconstructed from namespace entries on load, avoiding the O(N log N) rebuild cost on cold start for namespaces with 200+ entries. Snapshots are saved alongside namespace data and cleaned up on namespace deletion.
- **`store_batch` tool**: Bulk-store multiple entries in a single write-lock. Faster than repeated `store_memory` calls for batch imports. Each entry gets contextual prefix embedding. Returns stored count and duplicate warnings.
- **Storage Version Validation (JSON)**: `PersistenceManager` now validates `storageVersion` on load — rejects files from newer server versions (forward-compatibility guard), runs sequential migrations for older versions. Follows the same `RunMigrations()` pattern as `SqliteStorageProvider`. Current version bumped to v2.
- **`ToolError` structured error type**: Standard `{ status, error }` record for consistent MCP tool error responses. `FromException()` hides internal stack traces.
- **BM25 Semantic Gate**: Hybrid search now gates BM25 candidates through semantic similarity before RRF fusion, eliminating noise from keyword-only matches that are semantically irrelevant.
- **52-combination Regression Baseline**: Theory test covering all 13 IR benchmark datasets x 4 search modes (vector, hybrid, vector_rerank, hybrid_rerank) with minimum thresholds for Recall@K >= 0.20, MRR >= 0.20, nDCG@K >= 0.15.
- 7 new IR benchmark datasets: ambiguity-v1, distractor-v1, specificity-v1, scale-v1, compound-v1, contamination-v1, cluster-summary-v1.
- 125 new tests (total: 734 across 3 frameworks, up from 609).

### Changed
- **Tool Description Audit**: All 50 MCP tool descriptions rewritten for better LLM routing — shorter top-level descriptions (under 200 chars), "when to use" guidance, routing hints between similar tools (e.g., `remember` vs `store_memory`, `recall` vs `search_memory`).
- **Scale Recall Tuning**: Hybrid search cascade and RRF fusion parameters retuned for improved recall on large namespaces (500+ entries).
- Fixed stack trace leak in `ClusterTools.CreateCluster` error responses.
- Total tools: 50 (up from 49).

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Porter Stemming for BM25**: Lightweight Porter stemmer (steps 1-3) normalizes morphological variants in the BM25 tokenizer. "encrypting", "encryption", and "encrypted" all stem to "encrypt", dramatically improving keyword recall. Handles plurals (-s/-es/-ies), verb forms (-ed/-ing), and derivational suffixes (-tion/-ation/-ize/-ness/-ful/-ive/-al).
- **Expanded Synonym Maps**: 60+ new synonym mappings covering security (encrypt→TLS/cipher), ML (sequence→RNN/LSTM), systems (monitoring→observability/Prometheus), networking (protocol→HTTP/TCP), data/storage (cache→Redis/CDN), and general CS vocabulary bridges. Corresponding reverse maps added to DocumentEnricher for bidirectional vocabulary bridging.
- **Two-Stage Cascade Retrieval**: For namespaces ≥50 entries, hybrid search switches from parallel RRF fusion to cascade mode — BM25 boosts vector results (up to 15%) instead of introducing new candidates, eliminating BM25 noise at scale. Smaller namespaces retain full RRF fusion.
- **Auto-PRF Engagement**: Pseudo-Relevance Feedback automatically activates when hybrid search top score is low (<0.015 RRF). Extracts key terms from initial results and re-searches for improved recall. Only used if PRF improves the top score.
- **Category-Aware Score Boost**: 8% score boost when query tokens overlap with entry categories, improving disambiguation at scale (e.g., "security" query boosts entries categorized as "security").
- 19 new tests (Porter stemmer, BM25 stemming integration, expanded synonyms, expanded enrichment, category boost, auto-PRF).
- Total tests: 609 (up from 590).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Adaptive RRF Fusion**: Confidence-gated hybrid search — dynamically adjusts RRF k parameter based on vector search confidence. High confidence (>0.70) suppresses BM25 noise, low confidence (<0.50) amplifies BM25 rescue. Eliminates hybrid regression on clean vector matches.
- **Synonym Expansion Layer**: Query-time domain synonym mapping bridges vocabulary gaps between colloquial user queries and technical terminology. Directly fixes rw-q15 and c-q07 semantic gaps (e.g., "maintenance cleanup" → "accretion decay collapse").
- **Document Enrichment**: Auto-generates keyword aliases at store time using reverse synonym mapping. BM25 indexes both entry text and enrichment keywords for improved recall on informal queries.
- **Auto-Escalation Search**: Vector-only searches with low confidence (top score <0.50) automatically escalate to hybrid+synonym search, picking the best strategy without caller configuration.
- **`Keywords` field on `CognitiveEntry`**: Searchable keyword aliases for document enrichment. BM25 indexes keywords alongside main text. Auto-populated on upsert via `DocumentEnricher`.
- 21 new retrieval improvement tests (synonym expansion, document enrichment, adaptive RRF, auto-escalation, Keywords integration).
- Total tests: 590 (up from 569).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Multi-Agent Memory Sharing (Phase 6)**: Cross-agent namespace sharing with permission control. Set `AGENT_ID` env var per agent instance to enable namespace ownership and access control.
- **`cross_search` tool**: Search across multiple namespaces in a single call with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merge. Results annotated with source namespace. Supports hybrid search and reranking.
- **`share_namespace` tool**: Grant another agent read or write access to a namespace you own.
- **`unshare_namespace` tool**: Revoke an agent's access to a namespace you own.
- **`list_shared` tool**: List all namespaces shared with the current agent.
- **`whoami` tool**: Return current agent identity and accessible namespaces summary.
- **`NamespaceRegistry` service**: Manages namespace ownership and sharing permissions. Stores permission data in `_system_sharing` namespace. Backward compatible — default agent has unrestricted access.
- **`SearchMultiple` method**: Cross-namespace search with per-namespace retrieval and RRF fusion in `CognitiveIndex`.
- 26 new multi-agent tests (registry permissions, cross-search, sharing/unsharing, agent identity, backward compatibility).
- Total tools: 49 (up from 44). Multi-agent tools included in all tool profiles.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Hierarchical Expert Routing (HMoE)**: 3-level domain tree (root → branch → leaf) with coarse-to-fine semantic routing via cosine similarity. Supports 2-level and 3-level trees with automatic flat fallback. Zero LLM API calls — all routing uses local ONNX embeddings + SIMD dot products.
- **`get_domain_tree` tool**: Inspect the full expert hierarchy showing root domains, branches, and leaf experts.
- **`purge_debates` tool**: Clean up stale `active-debate-*` namespaces older than a configurable age with dry-run support.
- **Namespace cleanup infrastructure**: `DeleteNamespaceAsync` with cascade removal of entries, graph edges, and cluster memberships across JSON and SQLite backends.
- **`create_expert` enhancements**: `level` parameter (`root`, `branch`, `leaf`) and `parentNodeId` for hierarchical tree construction. **Auto-classification**: when `parentNodeId` is omitted for leaf experts, the system automatically scores the persona against all root and branch nodes and places the expert into the best-matching domain (`auto_linked` >= 0.82, `suggested` 0.60–0.82, `unclassified` < 0.60). Placement result is included in the response.
- **`dispatch_task` enhancements**: `hierarchical` parameter for tree-walk routing through domain nodes.
- **`link_to_parent` tool**: Link existing leaf experts to a parent node in the domain tree.
- 49 new tests (27 hierarchical routing + 9 auto-classification + 13 namespace cleanup), bringing total to 534.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **NuGet Build Optimizations**: Embedded debug `.pdb` symbols internally inside the distributed DLL.
- **Embedded Sources**: Added embedded source link mapping so consuming code can cleanly step into `McpEngramMemory.Core` logic directly during debug sessions, offering an unparalleled developer experience.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **McpEngramMemory.Core NuGet Package**: Split the core memory engine into an independent `net8.0` library, extractable via the `McpEngramMemory.Core.csproj` target build. Allows consumers to integrate the vector index natively in-process without relying on MCP RPC endpoints.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-09
